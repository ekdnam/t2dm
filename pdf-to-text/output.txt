Type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent disease with significant morbidity and mortality around the
world. However, there is no universally effective treatment, because response to different treatment regimens can
vary widely among patients. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether the use of the powdered dried leaves
of Eugenia punicifolia (Kunth) DC. (Myrtaceae) is effective as an adjuvant to the treatment of patients with
type-2 DM. Fifteen patients were enrolled in a pilot, non-controlled study, and received E. punicifolia for 3 months.
After treatment, we observed a significant decrease in glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, thyroid-stimulating
hormone, C-reactive protein, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. There were no changes in fasting and
postprandial glycemia. The compounds myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside, quercetin-3-O-galactoside, quercetin-3-O-
xyloside, quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside, kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside, phytol, gallic acid, and trans-caryophyllene
present in the powdered dried leaves of E. punicifolia may be responsible for the therapeutic effect. In conclusion,
the powdered leaves of E. punicifolia are promising as an adjuvant in the treatment of type-2 DM and deserve
further investigation. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

INTRODUCTION

Type-2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a highly prevalent dis-
ease, affecting more than 20 million people in the USA
(Blonde, 2010). It is responsible for significant morbidity
and mortality (Yeh et al., 2003; Blonde, 2010). However,
there is no universally effective treatment, because
response to different treatment regimens can vary widely
among patients (Blonde, 2009; Blonde, 2010).
The use of complementary and alternative treatments,

including the use of herbal medicines, is increasing among
diabetic people, because of poor adherence to treatment,
poor disease control, side effects of conventional drugs,
and cultural beliefs (Yeh et al., 2003; Hui et al., 2009).
Many plant species have been identified as promising
sources of new hypoglycemiant drugs (Yeh et al., 2003;
Negri, 2005; Rao et al., 2010). Despite this, only a few
herbal medicines have been proven useful in high-quality
studies (Hui et al., 2009).
Eugenia punicifolia (Kunth) DC. (Myrtaceae, ‘pedra-

ume-kaá’, Brazil) is a 1–4 m high shrub. From about 500
species of Eugenia, 400 are located in Brazil. Its leaves
have been traditionally used in the treatment of diabetic
patients (Brunetti et al., 2006) and possess
antiinflammatory and nicotinic antagonist activities

(Grangeiro et al., 2006; Leite et al., 2010). The methano-
lic and aqueous extracts of E. punicifolia, studied in an an-
imal model of diabetes, showed anorexic effect and
improved carbohydrate and protein metabolism without
toxicity (Brunetti et al., 2006). However, to date, this has
never been investigated in humans.

In this pilot, longitudinal, non-controlled study, we aimed
to investigate the effects of E. punicifolia on fasting and 2h
postprandial glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, and other
laboratorial tests in adults with type-2 DM. We hypothesized
that E. punicifolia can enhance disease control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

Study design. This is a pilot, longitudinal, non-controlled,
open, phase-2 interventional study, comparing patients
with themselves before and after the intervention. The
study was approved by our local institutional review
board (Research Ethics Committee of HCRP and
FMRP-USP, process #737/2011). A signed informed
consent was obtained from all patients.
Patients. All adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of
type-2 DM treated in our institution (Ambulatory of
Phytotherapeutics ‘Farmácia da Natureza’, Jardinópolis,
Brazil) were eligible for the study. Inclusion criteria

were age older than 18 years and a diagnostic of type-2
DM. The diagnosis of type-2 DM was made using the
World Health Organization recommendations (WHO,
2006): fasting glycemia ≥ 126 mg/dL or 2 h postprandial
glycaemia ≥ 200 mg/dL. The exclusion criterion was
known allergy to E. punicifolia. Patients were withdrawn
from the study in case of serious or severe adverse events.
The patients were followed for 3 months. All but one
patients were on regular treatment for DM (Table 1).
Preparation of the medicine. Leaves of E. punicifolia
were collected at 9 AM and dried in an oven with circulat-
ing air at 45°C for 36 h. They were then ground in a knife
mill and sieved to standardize the particle size (40 mesh).
The powdered dried leaves were administered in capsules
containing 200 mg each.
The plant was identified according to an authentic sample

by Dr Marcos Eduardo Guerra Sobral (taxonomist, Federal
University of São João Del-Rei, expert on Myrtaceae). A
voucher of E. punicifolia species was deposited at the
herbarium of the Biotechnology Department of the
University of Ribeirão Preto (UNAERP), with the refer-
ence number HPMU-1539.
Analytical procedures. Solvents and reagents. All solvents
and reagents were of the highest purity needed for each
application. Silylation reagents, N,O-bis (trimethylsilyl)
trifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) and trimethyl-cholorosilane
(TMCS), were purchased from Supelco and Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA), respectively.

Extraction and isolation. Dried leaves (0.2 kg) were ex-
haustively extracted with MeOH at room temperature.
The obtained extract was concentrated under reduced
pressure to remove organic solvents, affording 17.20 g of
crude extract, which was suspended in MeOH/H2O (8:2)

and partitioned with solvents of increasing polarities,
yielding hexane and ethyl acetate fractions.

Sample derivatization. Five milligrams of fraction was
dissolved in 100 μL of pyridine. The residue was
derivatized by adding 200 μL of BSTFA:TMCS/98:2
and heating for 90 min at 80°C. After cooling down to
room temperature, an aliquot of 200 μL was transferred
into the vials and diluted to 1 mL with EtOAc for gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.

HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS analysis. Phenolic profile of meth-
anolic extract of E. punicifolia was investigated according
Ferreres (Ferreres et al., 2012). For flavonoids identifica-
tion, 1 mg of ethyl acetate fraction was re-dissolved in
1 mL of MeOH:H2O (1:1), and sample was sonicated
and filtered (0.22 μ). High-performance liquid chroma-
tography–diode array detection/electrospray ionization-
mass spectrometry (HPLC-DAD/ESI-MS) analysis was
developed on a Shimadzu LC-6 AD apparatus with a
diode array detector (SPD-M10Avp; Shimadzu), coupled
with an auto-injector (SIL-10AF; Shimadzu) and Class-
VO 6.14 controller. Chromatographic analysis was carried
out on a Luna C18 column (250× 4.6mm× 5μm particle
size; Phenomenex, Macclesfield, UK). The mobile phase
consisted of water–acetic acid (1%) (A) and methanol
(B), starting with 20% B and using a gradient to obtain
50% B at 30min and 90% B at 35min. The injection vol-
ume was 20 μL, and the flow rate was 1mL/min. Spectral
data from all peaks were accumulated in the range
240–400nm, and chromatograms were recorded at 340 nm.

GC-MS analyses. For volatile compounds identification,
5mg of hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were
dissolved, separately, in 100μL of pyridine. The residues
were derivatized by adding 200 μL of BSTFA:TMCS/98:2
and heating for 90min at 80°C. After cooling down to
room temperature, an aliquot of 200 μL of each silanized
fraction was transferred into the vials and diluted to 1mL
with EtOAc for GC-MS analyses. Chromatographic analy-
ses were carried out using a gas chromatograph–mass
spectrometer (model QP-2010, Shimadzu Corp., Kyoto,
Japan); column DB-5ms (30 ×0.25mm× 0.25 μm) Agilent
J&W (Santa Clara, CA, USA); carrier gas helium; split
1:40; flow rate of 1.1mL/min; oven program: total run time:
73min; initial temperature at 100°C; ramp 3°C/min to 290°C;
hold 10min; injection volume 1μL; injector temperature was
set at 260°C. MS was operated in the positive ion mode, with
an ionization voltage of 70eV. The MS data were obtained in
full scan mode (50–600amu). A comparison of the mass
spectra ofsilylated compounds with those of the MS fragmen-
tation patterns of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (Nist 08 lib.) spectral database was carried out.

Essential oil analysis. The essential oil was extracted by
hydro-distillation in a Clevenger device during 2 h, using
100 g of fresh leaves into 1 L of distilled water. The
GC-MS analysis of the essential oil of E. punicifolia
was performed on a Varian Saturn 3900 GC/2100MS/
CP8410 injector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara,
CA, USA), using a VF-5 ms (WCOT fused silica) capil-
lary column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d.) under the following
conditions: helium as carrier gas at 1.0mL/min, injector split

at 240°C (split ratio of 1/10), electron impact ionization at
70eV (trap temperature 220°C), and oven temperature
programmed from 60C up to 240C at 3C/min. Injection
volume was 1μL of solution (1μL essential oil/1mL hex-
ane). Compounds of the oil were identified by comparison
of their mass spectra with those of Nist 62 library mass
spectra and confirmed by comparison of their retention
indices relative to C8-C20 n-alkanes (Adams, 1995).

Treatment protocol. All patients took one capsule
(200 mg) of the powdered plant material (leaves) of E.
punicifolia, orally, three times a day (after breakfast,
lunch, and dinner), for 3 months, in addition to their
current treatment. This regimen was arbitrarily chosen
to correspond to the main daily meals. Adherence was
assessed by questioning the subjects during the medical
interview. Blood pressure was recorded only in the visits.

Laboratory evaluation and toxicity. The following labo-
ratory tests were performed in all patients before and
after 3 months of treatment: fasting and 2 h postprandial
glycemia, glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, 24 h
microalbuminuria, ultra-sensible C-reactive protein
(usCRP), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), choles-
terol (total and fractions), and triglycerides. Toxicity was
assessed by measuring plasma aspartate transaminase,
alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, bili-
rubins, urea, creatinine, and creatine-phospho-kinase.

Data collection. The following data were collected from
medical charts and patient interviews: age, gender, body

Statistical analysis. Analysis was per-protocol. The
primary outcome was a reduction of at least 1% in glyco-
sylated hemoglobin. In order to detect such a difference
(paired analysis) after the intervention, with a standard
deviation of 1, significance of 5% and power of 80%, ten
subjects needed to be studied. Secondary outcomes
included fasting and 2h postprandial glycemia. Results
are expressed as median (range), mean (±SD), or counts
(percentages). Continuous variables were compared (be-
fore versus after treatment) using paired Student’s t-tests
or Wilcoxon’s test, according to data distribution. Categor-
ical variables were compared using Fisher’s exact tests.
Results were considered significant when p < 0.05.
RESULTS

Fifteen patients were screened and enrolled in the study
between May 2010 and August 2011. Their demographic
data are presented in Table 1. No patient was withdrawn
from the study.

After treatment, there was a significant reduction
from baseline on both systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, TSH, and
usCRP, whereas there was no significant change on the
other studied parameters (Table 2 and Figs 1 and 2).

Interestingly, the effects were stronger in patients with
more abnormal tests. The mean difference on glycosyl-
ated hemoglobin was of �0.96 (±1.32, with 95% confi-
dence interval of �0.30 to �1.63) %. There was no

Online Supplementary Table S1 shows the proportion
of patients fulfilling the 2010 American Diabetes Asso-
ciation (ADA) goals for the management of type-2
DM (American Diabetes Association, 2009).

On the basis of the results of HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS
analysis (Online Supplementary Table S2), five flavonoids
were identified in the leaves of E. punicifolia methanolic
extract: myricetin-3-O-rhamnoside (myricetin-3-O-R),
quercetin-3-O-galactoside (quercetin-3-O-Ga), quercetin-
3-O-xyloside (quercetin-3-O-X), quercetin-3-O-rhamnoside
(quercetin-3-O-R), and kaempferol-3-O-rhamnoside
(kaempferol-3-O-R). The GC-MS analyses of hexane
and ethyl acetate fractions showed the presence of two
major compounds: gallic acid and phytol (Online
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The essential oil from
the leaves of E. punicifolia contains, as major compo-
nent, (-) trans-caryophyllene (Table S3).
DISCUSSION

This study showed that, in patients with type-2 DM, a
3-month-long treatment with the powdered dried leaves
of E. punicifolia resulted in a significant reduction on
glycosylated hemoglobin, basal insulin, TSH, usCRP,
and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

It is interesting that we did not observe any effect on
fasting or postprandial glycemia in our patients. However,
according to recent studies, besides controlling glycemia,
it is equally important to control other cardiovascular risk
factors such as overweight, hypertension, and dyslipid-
emia (Kuritzky, 2010). The 2010 ADA guidelines for the
management of type-2 DM recommend achieving a
glycosylated hemoglobin <7.0%, fasting glycemia of
70–130 mg/dL, postprandial glycemia <180 mg/dL, LDL
cholesterol <100 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol >40 (women)
or >50 (men) mg/dL, and triglycerides <150 mg/dL
(American Diabetes Association, 2009). According to
rmone (TSH), and ultra-sensible C-reactive protein (usCRP) before
evels fell dramatically in two patients, whereas only moderately in
usCRP and TSH also fell dramatically in few patients whereas they

the data from 1999–2006 in the National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey, only 12.2% of patients
with DM achieved the recommended combined
targets for glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure,
and LDL cholesterol during this period (Kuritzky,
2010). In our study, there was a significant increase
in the proportion of patients achieving the 2010
ADA therapeutic goals (Table S3).
In a previously published study, a reduction of 1% on

glycosylated hemoglobin was associated with a 37%
reduction in the risk of microvascular complications
(Stratton et al., 2000). Similarly, intensive glycemic
control (glycosylated hemoglobin <7.0%) was associated
with lower rates of new onset or worsened nephropathy
or retinopathy, compared with patients randomized to
non-intensive therapy (conventional insulin) during
8 years of follow-up (Shichiri et al., 2000). In our study,
glycosylated hemoglobin mean decrease was of 0.96%,
and after treatment, 60% of patients had their glycosyl-
ated hemoglobin <7.0%. Another interesting finding of
our study was that usCRP decreased by more than a half
from baseline. If we speculate that the treatment caused
this reduction, then that might be an important finding
because chronic inflammation plays a role on long-term
complications of diabetes (Forbes and Cooper, 2013;
Tabas and Glass, 2013). Therefore, E. punicifolia may
be a good candidate for the prevention of complications
of type-2 DM. We also observed a reduction on TSH
levels, unexplained.
To explain the biological activities of E. punicifolia,

we conducted a chemical analysis of its components.
Flavonoids, gallic acid, and phytol identified in E.
punicifolia leaf extracts have significant antioxidant
activity (Galeno et al., 2013; Salgueiro et al., 2013;
Santos et al., 2013). It is well known that cells exposed
to natural antioxidants exhibit decreased insulin resis-
tance (Ruhe and McDonald, 2001). Hypoglycemic
effects of flavonoids have been demonstrated through
glucose uptake in peripheral tissues, regulatory activity
and expression of enzymes involved in carbohydrate me-
tabolism pathway (Choi et al., 1991; Matsuda et al., 2002;
Kamalakkannan and Prince, 2006). Histopathological
studies of pancreas of diabetic rats treated with gallic acid
showed that this compound preserves the pancreatic
tissue, enhance insulin secretion, promotes β-cell regener-
ation, and normalizes biochemical parameters related
to the patho-biochemistry of DM (Latha and Daisy,
2011; Punithavathi et al., 2011). Phytol and its analogs also
exhibit direct effects on diabetes, because they reduce
insulin resistance, promote glucose uptake in primary he-
patocytes, and are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptors (Elmazar et al., 2013).
The essential oil from the leaves of E. punicifolia is

rich in oxygenated sesquiterpenes and its major
component, the (-) trans-caryophyllene, which has
significant antiinflammatory activity (Fernandes et al.,
2007). It is also effective in reducing TNF-α-induced
prostaglandin E2 release, inducible nitric oxide
synthase, and cyclooxygenase-2, all inflammatory
mediators that negatively impact diabetes control.

Undoubtedly, the substances identified in leaf extracts
and essential oil of E. punicifolia can explain the clini-
cal results observed here.

Many authors advocate the use of individualized
therapies for patients with type-2 DM, taking into con-
sideration adverse effects of medications, medication
administration complexity, cost, ‘needle phobia’, and
comorbidities (Kuritzky, 2010). From this standpoint, our
results suggest that adding E. punicifolia to current
treatment regimens may improve control of type-2 DM
of at least selected patients. Moreover, there was no
evidence of toxicity or significant side effects. The adverse
effects reported were diarrhea and flatulence, which are
also common in patients using metformin and other
hypoglycemiant drugs, including herbal medicines (Dans
et al., 2007; Hui et al., 2009).

Many other herbal interventions have been reported
as useful for type-2 DM treatment, including Panax
ginseng, Momordica charantia, and Coptis chinensis
(Hui et al., 2009). However, to our knowledge, this is
the first to exhibit an effect of such magnitude on
disease control.

Our results have to be considered with caution.
Because this study was not placebo-controlled, we
cannot exclude a Hawthorne effect, that is, the patients
in the study may have been more prone to comply with
the treatment and diet. This effect might have been
further increased if patients consenting in participate
in the study were sympathetic to herbal treatments. In
addition, the use of the powdered leaves brings difficul-
ties in reproducibility by other researchers. On the other
hand, it was our intention to show that the plant has
biological effects ‘in natura’, without need of any extrac-
tion method. Other limitations are the small sample size,
which limits power and external validity, and lack of
monitoring at multiple time points during treatment.
We plan to address these issues in a larger phase-3,
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, which is
under consideration.

In conclusion, diabetic patients treated with E. punicifolia
as an adjuvant to standard treatment experienced a
marked reduction on their glycosylated hemoglobin, basal
insulin, TSH, usCRP, and both systolic and diastolic blood
pressure, without changes in fasting and postprandial
glycemia. Therefore, E. punicifolia deserves to be further
investigated in larger, randomized, placebo-controlled
clinical trials.
